## 🚀 Why FeelSearch?

🔍 Unlike traditional search engines, **FeelSearch** understands **context and emotion**, ensuring the most relevant, helpful, and empathetic results — whether you're a student, developer, or professional.

> "What if your search engine could feel your needs before you typed? That’s FeelSearch."

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🎭 **Emotion-Based Search** – Works on built-in and text-based emotion detection
- 🌐 **Cross-Platform** – Works seamlessly on PC, Mac, tablets, and mobile
- 💡 **Smart Suggestions** – Recommends productivity tools and educational resources
- 🪄 **Intuitive UI/UX** – Sleek design with real-time feedback
- 🔐 **Built with Privacy** – Data-secure, scalable architecture

> ⚠️ **Note:** At the moment, FeelSearch is working without a database as we are developing a **face detection–based user security module**. This ensures enhanced protection and emotion recognition. Database integration will be added soon.
